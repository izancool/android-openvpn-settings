<u><b>Disclaimer</b></u><br/>
<i>OpenVPN Settings</i> comes without any warranty and is beta software.
It might drain your battery quickly or otherwise influence the performance of your phone.<br/>
Use it at your own risk.
<p/>

<u><b>Prerequisites</b></u><br/>
- installed openvpn binary<br/>
- <i>tun</i> in kernel or <i>tun.ko</i><br/>
</ul>
<i>OpenVPN Settings</i> is being developed on current releases of CyanogenMod (4.2.13 or greater), which includes the <i>openvpn</i> binary and <i>tun</i>.
<p/>

<u><b>Features</b></u><br/>
- Wi-Fi Settings like user interface
- Restart tunnel when network connectivity changes (e.g. from wifi to 3g)
- Start tunnel on boot, according to last state<br/>
- Turn on/off openvpn service, saving individual tunnel state<br/> 
- Passphrase support<br/>
- Username/Password support (untested, please report any problems)<br/>
- Supports multiple independent tunnels<br/>
- Uses Management Interface<br/>
- Edit config file in text editor<br/>
<p/>

<u><b>Missing Features</b></u><br/>
- Setting the nameserver is not yet supported. (It is most likely that DNS will be messed up if it is not done properly, so please stay tuned)
- Display tunnel status in notification area

<u><b>Logging</b></u><br/>
Use <i>adb logcat</i> on your host.
<i>OpenVPN Settings</i> currently relies heavily on <i>adb logcat</i>
to give you all information about what's going on.
This comes in handy especially when setting up a new tunnel.
<p/>

<u><b>Setup</b></u><br/>
1. Connect your phone via USB to your computer and mount the sdcard.<br/>
2. Create a directory named <i>openvpn</i> at the root of your sdcard.<br/>
3. Copy your certificates and <i>*.config</i> files into that directory (The config files need to end in <i>.config</i> ).<br/>
4. Unmount the sdcard.
5. You might need to hit refresh from the menu if you started <i>OpenVPN Settings</i> already.<br/>
6. Start <i>adb logcat</i> on your computer to monitor activity.<br/>
7. Open activity <i>OpenVPN Settings</i> and enable your tunnel.<br/>

In general it would be best to get you config running from a shell, e.g. using <i>adb shell</i>.
